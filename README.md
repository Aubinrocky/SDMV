Goal: web app in which everybody can find sport events (V1: only tournaments) in his city. So far, tournaments are sent by Whatsapp on sport club conversations, and few people have access to their information.

My purpose: I already know well Django, Python and html/css/js, now I want to earn more experience in Vue.js. Once this project will be done, I will propose it to french cities, starting from Montpellier.

Stack: Vue.js, Django, Django Rest Framework, Python

State: Work In Progress
